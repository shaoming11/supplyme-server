## Description
SupplyMe is a web app that helps small business owners find and contact manufactureres by compiling the data on manufacturers of larger companies. By searching a product, users can discovertop manufacturers used by large companies, view details on them, and reach out. 
This repository contains the back end of the project.

## How It Works

SupplyMe allows business owners to type a natural-language prompt like:

> _"Find me metal water bottle manufacturers in Asia."_

This is converted into a vector and semantically searched using **Google Gemini**, and data is pulled from **ImportYeti**'s API. The combined results show:

- Verified manufacturers
- Associated brands/products
- HS codes and sourcing details
