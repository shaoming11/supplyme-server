## ðŸ§  How It Works

SupplyMe allows business owners to type a natural-language prompt like:

> _"Find me metal water bottle manufacturers in Asia."_

This is converted into a vector and semantically searched using **Google Gemini**, and data is pulled from **ImportYeti**'s API. The combined results show:

- Verified manufacturers
- Associated brands/products
- HS codes and sourcing details
